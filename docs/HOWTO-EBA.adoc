# What is Buying Project

Buying a large-ticket product or service is like working on a project, you need to spend time research prices and negotiate deals with sellers.  Buying Project is the project management tool developed by https://savenowclub.com[SaveNowClub] for large-ticket product or service buyers to create a public page to manage price research activities and/or sell your completed deal information to people who are in need of it.

Here is an https://savenowclub.com/projects/2143/price-research-for-a-used-suv-near-chicago[example buying project] that does price research on a used SUV near Chicago area.

Our Buying Project supports these types of buying targets:

* Vehicle (new or old)
* Piano (new or old)
* Insurance (any type of insurance)
* Property Tax Protesting Service
* Other

It's easy to create a Buying Project, simply fill out https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project[this form], describe your goal (price research or share/sell deal information) in Description field.  After the project is created and public, share the project link with your friends or on public forums so you will get help needed or people can find price records they need.

## Comment to Buying Project

Buying Projects are like questions asked by buyers that solicit answers from other people who may have answers, in many cases, these questions lack certain information for other people to better understand the needs in order to better answer it, when this happens, comment feature can be used to ask clarifying questions to project owners or answering these questions.  Once a comment is submitted, email notices will be sent to project owner and comment creator.

See screen shot below for an example of comment section of an existing Buying Project.

## Buying Group

Buying Group is a type of Buying Project that allows buyers to join as members and collectively pursue a deal for a common product.

To create a Buying Group, simply check `Make this a Buying Group` checkbox when you create a Buying Project

If you are organizing or about to join a Buying Group, consider the following advantage of SaveNowClub's Buying Group vs. Google Form

* membership information of a Buying Group can be modified or deleted, while it's not possible to do it on Google Form
* Buying Group page is public and easy to attract new members while keeping membership information private, but Google Form address is usually private and cannot generate organic traffic.
* Group Members' email addresses will be verified while Google Sheet does not verify email addresses of sign up members
* Buying Group page mixes public and private project notes, private project notes only visible to verified and logged in group members
* Buying Group page mixes public and private updates, private updates are only visible to group members
* Creation and change of each public or private updates will be emailed to every group member and the email message does not expose other group members' email addresses

# What is Price Record

After a buying project is created, one or multiple price/deal data points may be added to it, these price/deal data points are called **Price Records**, these are what people look for when they research prices on their buying targets.  Buytition supports two types of price records: price offer and price paid.

Here is an https://savenowclub.com/projects/2143/price-research-for-a-used-suv-near-chicago#t86[example price record] of a price offer for a used SUV near Chicago area.

Each price record is made up of 3 parts: public information, private information and dedicated mailbox

* **public information**: accessible by general public, includes product/service name, price, area/zip code, and public description
* **private information**: accessible by owner and buyers of price record only, includes
** available to both owner and buyers of price record: dealer information, deal making descriptions
** available to only owner: source URL, vehicle VIN
* **dedicated mailbox**: accessible by owner of price record only, the mailbox comes with these handy benefits
** an email address (e.g. bot2111@buytition.com) dedicated to this price record, your personal email sits behind this email address so your privacy is protected.
** all inbound/outbound email messages regarding a price record are organized in one place
** <<step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller, collaborative communication to seller>> and <<step-31-peer-to-peer-communication, peer-to-peer communication>>
** <<step-4-2-one-click-turn-on-off-agent, one-click mute incoming emails>>
** <<step-3-how-to-use-proxy-email, reply directly>> from your personal email account
** each inbound/outbound message is tagged with price record link so you can easily trace it back to its original intent.

# Price Record Marketplace

1. **trustworthy**: the accuracy of price record is verified by SaveNowClub using either or both of these two methods:
** **source verified**: the price record was published at least once on the Internet before being listed for sale, therefore this price record has at least one third-party source.

# Demo

## Step 1: Create a Buying Project

Open https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project[Start Project] page to create a buying project for free and use it as a **car buying worksheet** to track all target vehicles and negotiations around them.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buying-project.png[create buying project]

After you submit the above simple form, the project is created like this or can be viewed https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget[here]

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-project-created.png[buying project created]

## Step 2: Add Email Buyer Agent to Buying Project
After your buying project is created, now you can start adding buyer agent to it

### Step 2.1: Find Your Target Vehicle Online

Look for your target vehicle online and grab its URL (link on browser), we recommend you to use links that has vehicle specific details (VIN, MSRP and price quotes), such as the one below

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/grab-vehicle-url.png[grab vehicle URL]

### Step 2.2: Create Email Buyer Agent

After target vehicle page is available, go back to the https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget[buying project] you just created in <<step-1-create-a-buying-project, previous step>>, scroll to the bottom, click **Add Buyer Agent** link

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-project-bottom.png[buying project bottom]

Fill out **Create Buyer Agent** form with vehicle name, vehicle URL and other vehicle details info found in <<step-21-find-your-target-vehicle-online,previous step>>, and click `Submit` button

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buyer-agent-top.png[create Email Buyer Agent]
image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buyer-agent.png[create Email Buyer Agent]

Now a Email Buyer Agent proxy email (`bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` in this case) is created, all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buyer-agent-created.png[Buyer Agent created notice]

### Step 2.3: Car Buying Worksheet

The created buyer agent will show up in the Buying Project page as shown below or can be accessed https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget#b42[here].  Buyer may add any number of such Buyer Agents and modify them to keep track all target vehicle and negotiation at one place so the buying project becomes buyer's buying worksheet.

## Step 3: How to use Proxy Email

After Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, a Proxy Email address is created.  The EBA proxy email is a powerful tool that enables easy three-way communication between project author, EBA author, and seller i.e. anybody else.

### Step 3.1: Peer-to-Peer Communication

Let's say I am helping Project Author on this buying project, and I created this EBA, very likely Project Author and I need to communicate with each other, for that purpose, I simply write an email to EBA proxy email address, in this demo `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com`, and send it, and EBA will forward that email to project author.  And vice versa, if project author does the same, I will receive that email from him/her.

The difference between this type of communication vs <<step-3-2-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller, seller communication>> is that for seller communication, you always need to reply an incoming email, but for peer-to-peer communication, you start from scratch and send it.

### Step 3.2: Collaboratively Communicate with Seller

A while after an EBA is created, EBA author will start receiving emails from seller,  which will be copied to project author as well if he/she was not EBA author.

In this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-01.png[inbound email top]

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price.  If project author is a different person, he/she may reply to same email as well and I will be copied with that reply so I am notified that project author has replied.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/outbound-mail-01.PNG[reply dealer email, 365,649]


Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Email Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Email Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-03.png[inbound email]

## Step 4: Manage Email Buyer Agent


For creator of the buyer agent, after login, you will be able to check out your own private information such as proxy email address, your full name, a link to email messages between you and dealer through this buyer agent and a button to turn on / off this buyer agent with one click.


### Step 4.1: Check Buyer Agent Emails

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 34 emails see below

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-after-login.png[email buyer agent after login]

Clicking on email icon will show you all 34 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.

### Step 4.2 One Click Turn On / Off Agent

Turn on or off buyer agent with one click, one click to unsubscribe from all messages from sender without worrying about filling out complex form to unsubscribe

image::https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-turned-off.png[buyer agent turned off]

or turn on
