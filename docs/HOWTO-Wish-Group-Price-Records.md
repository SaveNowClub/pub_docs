Here is the an example wished item: [Audi Q7 SUV](https://savenowclub.com/items/audi-q7).

# What is Price Record

Price Records are records of price offered by seller for a product or service ([wished item](#what-is-wished-item)), they are what people look for when they research prices on their wished items.  

## Types of Price Records

SaveNowClub supports two types of price records: price offer and price paid.

### Price Offer

These are currently active price quotes offered from sellers, for example, this offer on [2020 Ford Expedition MAX XLT](/projects/2441/price-offer-for-2020-ford-expedition-max-xlt#t326), it was posted on 2/1/2021, and it will stay valid until the listed product is sold or the price gets changed by seller.

Here is another [example price offer](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2143/price-research-for-a-used-suv-near-chicago#t86) of a price offer for a used SUV near Chicago area.

### Price Paid

These are past price paid records contributed by other buyers.  This is an [example price paid](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2413/buying-group-for-toyota-sienna-toyota-highlander-honda-odyssey-acura-mdx-nissan-armada#t310) for 2020 Toyota Highlander.  Since these records reflect transaction already happened, they generally do not expire.

## Components of Price Records

Each price record is made up of 3 parts: public information, private information and dedicated mailbox

* **public information**: accessible by general public, includes product/service name, price, area/zip code, and public description
* **private information**: accessible by owner and buyers of price record only, includes
    * available to both owner and buyers of price record: dealer information, deal making descriptions
    * available to only owner: source URL, vehicle VIN
* **dedicated mailbox**: optionally attached to a price record, accessible by owner of price record or group members of a buying group only. See [section](#dedicated-mailbox) below for more details

### Dedicated Mailbox

As you create a [Price Record](#what-is-price-record), you may choose to add a Dedicated Mailbox to it, the mailbox comes with these handy benefits

* an email address (e.g. `bot2111@buytition.com`) dedicated to this price record, your personal email sits behind this email address so your privacy is protected.
* all inbound/outbound email messages regarding a price record are organized in one place
* [collaborative communication to seller](https://savenowclub.com/docs/2556/demo-of-features#step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller) and [peer-to-peer communication](https://savenowclub.com/docs/2556/demo-of-features#step-31-peer-to-peer-communication)
* [one-click mute incoming emails](https://savenowclub.com/docs/2556/demo-of-features#step-42-one-click-turn-on-off-agent)
* [reply directly](https://savenowclub.com/docs/2556/demo-of-features#step-3-how-to-use-proxy-email) from your personal email account
* each inbound/outbound message is tagged with price record link so you can easily trace it back to its original intent.

**Collaborative Negotiation**

As of Dec. 2021, this feature is deprecated as it is related to Buying Project which has been deprecated.

You may collaborate on email negotiation with dealer to nail down the deal by checking `collboratively negotiate` box.

# What Is Buying Group

Buying Groups are [price records](#what-is-price-record) that are on sale that allow multiple buyers to purchase a product at a discounted price.  Buyers who make purchase will get actual products / services in return.  

## Benefits of Buying Group

If you are organizing or about to join a Buying Group, consider the following advantage of SaveNowClub’s Buying Group vs. Google Form vs. WeChat Groups vs. Facebook Groups

**Membership Management**

* Membership information of a Buying Group can be modified or deleted, while it’s not possible to do it on Google Form
* Group Members' email addresses will be verified while Google Sheet does not verify email addresses of sign up members
* Advantage over Facebook Groups: Members may remain anonymous to the public and to each other group members, while you have to show your real name in Facebook Groups

**Marketing Advantages**

* Buying Group page is public and easy to attract new members while keeping membership information private, but Google Form address is usually private and cannot generate organic traffic.
* Advantage over WeChat Groups: the fact that SaveNowClub buying group has a public page and allows dealers / brokers to join makes it easier to attract sellers to make offer to the group and to reach a deal, while WeChat Groups are private and lack a public page to attract sellers to make an offer.
