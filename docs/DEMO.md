## Step 1: Create a Buying Project

If you don't have an account yet, click [create an account](https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project) using a personal email address (in this tutorial I use `buytition.car@gmail.com`) and use it to [sign in](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/signin) to SaveNowClub.  If you have not verified your personal email yet, then click `Reset Password` button to verify it.

Open [Start Project](https://savenowclub.com/projects/show-form/start-project) page to create a buying project for free and use it as a **car buying worksheet** to track all target vehicles and negotiations around them.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/create-buying-project.png" title="create buying project" style="max-width:100%">

After you submit the above simple form, the project is created like this or can be viewed [here](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget)

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/buying-project-created.png" title="buying project created" style="max-width:100%">

## Step 2: Add Listing to Buying Project
After your buying project is created, now you can add listing / price record to it in order to find a better deal to beat your listing or sell its information to other buyers who try to replicate your deal.

### Step 2.1: Find Your Target Vehicle Online

Look for your target vehicle online and grab its URL (link on browser), we recommend you to use links that has vehicle specific details (VIN, MSRP and price quotes), such as the one below

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/grab-vehicle-url.png" title="grab vehicle URL" style="max-width:100%">

### Step 2.2: Add Listing to Buying Project

After target vehicle page is available, go directly to [Add Listing section](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget#action_add_update) of the project you just created in [previous step](#step-1-create-a-buying-project)

Fill out **Add Listing** form with vehicle name, vehicle URL and other vehicle details info found in [previous step](#step-21-find-your-target-vehicle-online), and click `Add Listing` button at bottom of form

You may sell information of your deal by checking `List information you enter in Keep These Private section below for sale` box and set a price yourself.  All price records on sale must satisfy  [listing criteria](#for-sellers-listing-criteria), otherwise listing will be removed from sale.

You may also create a dedicated mailbox by checking `Create dedicated mailbox` box in the form.  After submitting the form, `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` in this case was created, all you need to do is sit back and wait for dealer emails to come in.

### Step 2.3: Car Buying Worksheet

The created buyer agent will show up in the Buying Project page as shown below or can be accessed [here](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2122/price-research-for-a-mid-size-suv-at-40k-budget#b42).  Buyer may add any number of such Buyer Agents and modify them to keep track all target vehicle and negotiation at one place so the buying project becomes buyer's buying worksheet.

## Step 3: How to use Proxy Email

After Email Buyer Agent (EBA) is created, a Proxy Email address is created.  The EBA proxy email is a powerful tool that enables easy three-way communication between project author, EBA author, and seller i.e. anybody else.

### Step 3.1: Peer-to-Peer Communication

Let's say I am helping Project Author on this buying project, and I created this EBA, very likely Project Author and I need to communicate with each other, for that purpose, I simply write an email to EBA proxy email address, in this demo `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com`, and send it, and EBA will forward that email to project author.  And vice versa, if project author does the same, I will receive that email from him/her.

The difference between this type of communication vs [seller communication](#step-32-collaboratively-communicate-with-seller) is that for seller communication, you always need to reply an incoming email, but for peer-to-peer communication, you start from scratch and send it.

### Step 3.2: Collaboratively Communicate with Seller

A while after an EBA is created, EBA author will start receiving emails from seller,  which will be copied to project author as well if he/she was not EBA author.

In this demo, I entered a Gmail address, so it arrives at Gmail inbox like this.  You see the email was forwarded from `bagent_barbXXXX@buytition.com` which is proxy email I created in previous step. In this email, dealer quoted a price of $44,954 for my target vehicle.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/inbound-mail-01.png" title="inbound email top" style="max-width:100%">

I reply it directly from my Gmail mobile app and made a counter-offer of $2000 lower than dealer's quoted price.  If project author is a different person, he/she may reply to same email as well and I will be copied with that reply so I am notified that project author has replied.

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/outbound-mail-01.PNG" title="reply dealer email" style="max-width:369px;" <!--365,649-->>

Dealer respond to my price offer and I am ready to make a deal with dealer.  Additionally, you may notice the red circled `here` link at top right of screenshot below, it is exactly the target vehicle link you have added to Email Buyer Agent earlier.  That link is attached by Email Buyer Agent to the bottom of every dealer email you receive as buyer, so you may keep track of purpose of this conversation.

### Collaborative Group Negotiation Demo

Take for example the [dedicated mailbox](#dedicated-mailbox) `bot2270@buytition.com` that comes with [this price offer](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2290/2020-2021-audi-q7-buy-group#t245) for [Audi Q7 buying group](https://savenowclub.com/projects/2290/2020-2021-audi-q7-buy-group):

* all of its inbound or outbound email messages are visible (via [the link](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/messages?srch_term=BUYER_AGENT_ID:2270) next to the mailbox after login) to all participating buyers including price record owner, project owner and group members (if project is a buying group), in addition, participating buyers are allowed to reply to inbound emails on our website by clicking the bright orange icon on upper right corner of message detail page ([this](https://savenowclub.com/web/dist/view_msg?id=70321) for example, member login required).
* its mailbox `bot2270@buytition.com` was created with the price record of 2021 Audi Q7 in MD, but it can also be used to negotiate deal with multiple dealers, simply use that address to start negotiation with any Audi dealers and email messages will be viewable and reply-able on this website by all group members.

## Step 4: Manage Email Buyer Agent

For creator of the buyer agent, after login, you will be able to check out your own private information such as proxy email address, your full name, a link to email messages between you and dealer through this buyer agent and a button to turn on / off this buyer agent with one click.

### Step 4.1: Check Buyer Agent Emails

If email exist for any target vehicles, Buyer Worksheet will show total count of emails (received and sent) at lower right corner for that vehicle.  For `2020 Volv XC60` vehicle in this example, we have total 34 emails see below

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-after-login.png" title="email buyer agent after login" style="max-width:100%">

Clicking on email icon will show you all 34 email messages between myself and dealer regarding this vehicle.

### Step 4.2 One Click Turn On / Off Agent

Turn on or off buyer agent with one click, one click to unsubscribe from all messages from sender without worrying about filling out complex form to unsubscribe

<img src="https://github.com/Buytition/pub_docs/raw/master/images/VBA-tutorials/b42-turned-off.png" title="buyer agent turned off" style="max-width:100%">

or turn on
