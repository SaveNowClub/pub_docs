# About Us

The website [SaveNowClub](https://savenowclub.com) was officially launched in 2020, it was a result of multiple pivots and product launches we did in previous years.  Since then we pivoted a few more times and ended up with two main online tool offerings: Timelines of Uncertainties and Price Research Tools.  Below are a few software tools offered by SaveNowClub.com:

## Timeline of Uncertainties

[Timeline of Uncertainties](/timeline) is a tool that helps people better predict outcome of uncertainties by focusing on the uncertainty you care about while keeping track what happened, what are happening, what were predicted to happen, and how accurate those predictions turn out to be around that uncertainty.  The tool solves the problem of how to focus one's attention on the uncertainty itself without losing track of what others have predicted and what facts have happened around that uncertainty.  The tool allows users to

1. [quickly save articles](/docs/2889/howto-timeline-of-uncertainties#use-bookmarklet-to-quickly-save-timeline-item) that are relevant to the uncertainty you care about; 
1. [quickly categorize saved articles](/docs/2889/howto-timeline-of-uncertainties#use-parent-chooser-to-quickly-organize-saved-timeline-item) under relevant uncertainty/theme; 
1. saved articles are presented to you in timeline fashion under relevant uncertainty;

## Price Research Tools

SaveNowClub also offers a number of tools to help buyers to research price for your buying targets, including

* [wishes](/docs/2371/tutorial-buying-groups-and-price-records#what-is-wish) are  user-created web pages that publishes user's intention to buy a product / service ([wished item](/docs/2371/tutorial-buying-groups-and-price-records#what-is-wished-item)) at certain desired terms. 
* [price records](/docs/2371/tutorial-buying-projects-and-price-records#what-is-price-record) are records of price offered by seller for a product or service (wished item), they are what people look for when they research prices on their wished items.
* [price calculator](/web/ttl-otd-price-converter)  helps vehicle buyers / sellers to convert TTL (Pre-Tax Title and License) price to OTD (Out-of-The-Door) price or vice versa with a few clicks.
