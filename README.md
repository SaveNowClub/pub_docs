# About Us

The website [SaveNowClub](https://savenowclub.com) was officially launched in 2020, it was a result of multiple pivots and product launches we did in previous years.  Since then we pivoted a few more times and ended up with two main online tool offerings: Timelines and Price Research Tools.  Below are a few software tools offered by SaveNowClub.com:

## Timeline

[Timeline](/timeline) is a tool that helps people to manage knowledge base with the vision of adding knowledge in any form with one click and empowering user to quickly absorb and organize the added knowledge.  As of October 2024, the tool solves the problems of enabling user to add link or content with one click to knowledge base and organizing saved contents under user-defined topics.  The tool allows users to

1. [quickly save articles](/docs/2889/howto-timeline-of-uncertainties#use-bookmarklet-to-quickly-save-timeline-item) that are relevant to the uncertainty you care about; 
1. [quickly categorize saved articles](/docs/2889/howto-timeline-of-uncertainties#use-parent-chooser-to-quickly-organize-saved-timeline-item) under relevant uncertainty/theme; 
1. saved articles are presented to you in timeline fashion under relevant uncertainty;

## Price Research Tools

SaveNowClub also offers a number of tools to help buyers to research price for your buying targets, including

* [wishes](/docs/2371/tutorial-buying-groups-and-price-records#what-is-wish) are  user-created web pages that publishes user's intention to buy a product / service ([wished item](/docs/2371/tutorial-buying-groups-and-price-records#what-is-wished-item)) at certain desired terms. 
* [price records](/docs/2371/tutorial-buying-projects-and-price-records#what-is-price-record) are records of price offered by seller for a product or service (wished item), they are what people look for when they research prices on their wished items.
* [price calculator](/web/ttl-otd-price-converter)  helps vehicle buyers / sellers to convert TTL (Pre-Tax Title and License) price to OTD (Out-of-The-Door) price or vice versa with a few clicks.
